title: "Research"

My research spans several areas within ecology and multi-disciplinary conservation science. My project goals have ranged from understanding the basic ecology of marine ecosystems to devising new theoretical models for understanding and projecting the temperature-dependence of biodiversity-maintaining mechanisms in nature. Past and current projects include metacommunity ecology of invertebrates in temperate seagrass (Zostera marina) meadows, social equity in conservation, and linking the Metabolic Theory of Ecology with other modern biodiversity theories to better understand how temperature governs processes that drive and maintain biodiversity patterns.
