Our world's greatest challenges require multi-disciplinary solutions. For this reason, I deliberately straddle my time between academic research as a marine ecologist, and conservation policy research and advocacy in the non-profit sector.

I am currently a PhD candidate in Mary O'Connor's Lab at the Biodiversity Research Centre at UBC. My research develops and tests theory describing how warming affects dynamical processes that drive species diversity and abundance. I work mostly on invertebrates in temperate seagrass ecosystems, and have some experience in vegetated Arctic ecosystems.

Outside my scientific research, I conduct multi-disciplinary work on a contract basis on topics including social equity in conservation, environmentally harmful subsidy reform, and mobilizing the blue economy.
